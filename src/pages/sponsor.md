# Become a YOURLS Sponsor

YOURLS is an [MIT licensed](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/blob/master/LICENSE)
open source project and completely free to use.

The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and
develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to donations and the
generous financial backing of our sponsors.

Did YOURLS help you build something neat for yourself?
Does your company use YOURLS?
Help the project, become a sponsor and get your logo on our README on Github with a link to your site.

## How to Sponsor

Donations and sponsorships can be done via the following methods:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/YOURLS)
- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/yourls)

Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted, using various payment methods (credit cards, Paypal, even crypto currencies). Invoices can be obtained.

Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in [Sponsorship Tiers](#tier-benefits).

To all those who donate to the project: **thank you**!
