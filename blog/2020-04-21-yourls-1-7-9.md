YOURLS update: the latest release is now **1.7.9** and you will find it, as usual and only, on [YOURLS release page](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7.9) on GitHub.

## What's new?

This release could have been nicknamed "the Quarantine Edition" since, because or thanks to the corona-lockdown (day 35 and counting) I've had quite some time to fix things and improve stuff, as you'll see on the release page.

Truth be told, I'm also pushing this release as a **security update**. Last night, the DJ didn't save my life, but the server hosting [api.yourls.org](https://api.yourls.org) was compromised. As a result, you may have seen a message in your YOURLS admin interface advertising a 1.7.8 release with an unusual download link. This was quickly noticed and fixed but a couple hundreds people still downloaded the fake archive, so I'm pushing a newer one for everyone.

## How to update?

Update as usual: download files and overwrite all existing files on your server (your personal files such as plugins or config will remain untouched).
