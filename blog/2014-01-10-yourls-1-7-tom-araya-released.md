I'm pleased to announce the release of [YOURLS 1.7 "Tom Araya"](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7 'We have the best release names.').

## \\m/ Tom Araya \\m/

In our now centennial tradition of naming YOURLS releases after a metal vocalist, I'm dedicating this release to Tom Araya, from the most excellent badass old-school thrash band we all love, Slayer. Well, _vocalist_, or maybe _screamist_, you be the judges ðŸ™‚ Before you continue reading, feel free to crank up some good ol' [relaxing tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_PcXKk0adI).

## Update now. Seriously, now\\';UPDATE \`your_table\` WITH \`crap\`

YOURLS 1.7 brings several exciting new features, and I will cover major ones in an upcoming series of short blog posts. If you're of the TL;DR type, check the [changelog](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7).

The first feature I want to highlight is not even a feature, it's a bugfix: in YOURLS 1.7 we have scrutinized several aspects regarding security and we have fixed a **potential SQL injection vulnerability**.

If you run YOURLS for your own and only use, update ASAP, but if you run a public URL shortener, update riiiiiiiiiiight nooooooooooooow (read that in Tom Araya's voice to get the feeling)

This update is a **simple drop-in replacement**: download the latest archive, unzip and upload to your server, overwriting existing files. No update procedure, no DB upgrade.

Update as soon as you can, and do your friends a favor: tell them a new version of YOURLS is out and they should update, tweet and retweet the good word.

## Executive summary

Update **now**. Blog posts about awesome features in the next days.
