Hello world! Your favorite URL shortener just got some love and the latest is now [YOURLS 1.7.1](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7.1). Update and let your friends know!

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Lots of bug fixes, lots of improvements, nothing that will rock your socks in awe, but several things you won't notice because they just work better ðŸ™‚ See the [changelog](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7.1) for more details.

## How to update?

If updating through the command line is too hardcore for you, just download the archive and overwrite your existing install. This update doesn't contain anything scary, but of course that's no reason not to have a proper backup of your data from time to time, right? ðŸ™‚

## What's next?

We'll continue our slow trip down the [road map](https://github.com/orgs/YOURLS/projects) but the most noticeable change for a few of you will be that we are going to start breaking things!

- we're dropping PHP 5.2 support. As of today **3.8%** of all YOURLS installs run this super deprecated PHP version: [folks, please](https://i.imgur.com/Nl0Fmpp.jpg).
- We'll probably drop MySQL support as well. An overhaul of the DB stuff has been planned for long, MySQL is deprecated in newer PHP builds, so we'll very most likely switch to PDO. Sorry for the **1.9%** of you that don't have PDO installed on their server, but that is not something that's acceptable from a decent web host ðŸ™‚

Update and tell your friends and family to update too!
