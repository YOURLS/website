We've just released [YOURLS 1.10.2](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.10.2)!

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Another set of minor bug fixes, the most important one being on the YOURLS container image.
The container with Apache HTTP now listens on ports 8080 and 8443.
You'll find the detailed changelog on the release page.

## How to update?

This release doesn't alter the database, it's the typical case of "upload files over older ones and forget", which as always doesn't affect your plugins and user config.
And as always, if it's been a long time since your last DB backup, now would be a good time of course.
