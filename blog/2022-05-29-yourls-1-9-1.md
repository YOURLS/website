We've just released [YOURLS 1.9.1](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.9.1)!

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Mostly minor bug fixes, the most important one being an error occurring when someone would update from a long version ago. People who update their YOURLS instances when there is a new version were not affected by this bug, I'll let you decide if there is a lesson here ðŸ˜‰ You'll find the detailed changelog on the release page.

## How to update?

This release doesn't alter the database, it's the typical case of "upload files over older ones and forget", which as always doesn't affect your plugins and user config. And as always, if it's been a long time since your last DB backup, now would be a good time of course.
