Hello everyone, we're excited to announce the release of [YOURLS 1.10](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.10.0) \\o/

## Salute to Tatiana Â« Tati Â» Shmayluk \\m/

In our tradition to name a new release after a metal vocalist, we're dedicating 1.10 to Tatiana "Tati" Shmayluk, frontwoman of Ukrainian heavy metal band [Jinjer](http://jinjer-metal.com/). I'm in awe of her ability to scream her throat out almost every night on tour, and her courage to face anxiety off-stage without the help of alcohol (two years sober!). If you haven't listened to Jinjer before, why not start with the badass title track from their new album, ["DuÃ©l"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEt3MajR0cU)? ðŸ¤˜

## What's new this time?

YOURLS 1.10 is a big jump for future compatibility. Most of the work that went into this release was on making sure PHP 8.4 and MySQL 8+ will work. Of course, there are also bug fixes: to the login page, searching your shorturls, and API return codes.

Note that YOURLS now requires **PHP 8.1** as a minimum. We also run tests on every version up to and including PHP 8.4.

Those interested will find more boring details in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) as usual.

### Even more documentation improvements

We took our VuePress docs and made them even better. The documentation now lives inside YOURLS' main website at [yourls.org/docs](https://yourls.org/docs), putting everything together for us to keep updated more easily. Switching to Docusaurus 2 helped with that **AND** kept both of the main points for users:

- The whole website is fully searchable with as-you-type page & section suggestions

- There's still an "Edit this page" link to quickly propose fixes to [YOURLS/website](https://github.com/YOURLS/website).

## Wrapping it up

Over the years YOURLS has been consistently in the [Top 100 PHP projects on GitHub](https://github.com/ozh/top_100_PHP_projects) and we are really humbled and honoured. From the bottom of our hearts, we're sending a warm thank you to every people using YOURLS in small personal projects or large corporate environment, to people writing plugins and providing materials that make a [vivid ecosystem](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls), to people [financially supporting](https://yourls.org/sponsor) the project, and to everyone telling the world about it!

Now it's time to do your part!
