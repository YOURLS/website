Hello world, and happy new year everyone!

This year 2019 starts with a maintenance release of YOURLS, bumping its version to [YOURLS 1.7.3](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.7.3).

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Mostly lil bug fixes and small enhancements here and there, nothing breath taking, but we thought it might be a good idea to push a release that would reflect changes committed this past months, mostly for folks who install "stable" releases, either manually or using third party tools.

## How to update?

Same as usual, download the archive and overwrite all existing files. While youâ€™re at it, backup your database because this is one of your new year resolutions, and tell your friends and family to update too!

Love and short links to all!
