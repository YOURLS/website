# Configuration

This page details how you are supposed to edit your `user/config.php` (with a raw text editor such as Notepad)

## MySQL settings

### `YOURLS_DB_USER`

MySQL username. Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_DB_USER', 'joe' );
```

### `YOURLS_DB_PASS`

MySQL password. Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_DB_PASS', 'MySeCreTPaSsW0rd' );
```

### `YOURLS_DB_NAME`

The database name. Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_DB_NAME', 'yourls' );
```

### `YOURLS_DB_HOST`

Database host. Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

### `YOURLS_DB_PREFIX`

The name prefix for all the tables YOURLS will need.Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_DB_PREFIX', 'yourls_' );
```

## Site options

### `YOURLS_SITE`

Your (hopefully short) domain URL, no trailing slash, lowercase. If you pick the non-www version of your domain, don't use the www version in your browser (and vice-versa). Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_SITE', 'https://your-own-domain-here.com' );
```

### `YOURLS_PRIVATE`

Private means the admin area will be protected with login/pass as defined below.

See [related page](/docs/guide/essentials/private-or-public).

Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', true );
```

### `YOURLS_UNIQUE_URLS`

Allow multiple short URLs for a same long URL.
Set to true to allow only one pair of short URL / long URL (default YOURLS behavior), or to false to allow creation of multiple short URLs pointing to the same long URL (as `bit.ly` does)

Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_UNIQUE_URLS', true );
```

### `YOURLS_COOKIEKEY`

A random secret hash used to encrypt cookies. You don't have to remember it, make it long and complicated. Hint: generate a unique one at [yourls.org/cookie](https://yourls.org/cookie)

Example:

```php
define( 'YOURLS_COOKIEKEY', 'qQ4KhL_pu|s@Zm7n#%:b^{A[vhm' );
```

### `$yourls_user_passwords`

A list of username(s) and password(s) allowed to access the site if private.
Passwords can either be in plain text, or encrypted. See [related page](/docs/guide/essentials/credentials).

Example:

```php
$yourls_user_passwords = array(
    'joe' => 'MyPassword',
);
```

## URL Shortening settings

### `YOURLS_URL_CONVERT`

How short URLs will be generated. See [related page](/docs/guide/essentials/charset). Example:

```php
define('YOURLS_URL_CONVERT', 36);
```

### `$yourls_reserved_URL`

A list of reserved keywords that won't be used as short URLs. Define here negative, unwanted or potentially misleading keywords

Example:

```php
'porn', 'faggot', 'sex', 'nigger', 'fuck', 'cunt', 'dick'
```

## Optional settings

### `YOURLS_PRIVATE_INFOS`

If YOURLS_PRIVATE is set to `true`, you can still make stat pages public. Example:

```php
define('YOURLS_PRIVATE_INFOS', false);
```

### `YOURLS_PRIVATE_API`

If YOURLS_PRIVATE is set to `true`, you can still make your API public. Example:

```php
define('YOURLS_PRIVATE_API', false);
```

### `YOURLS_NOSTATS`

If YOURLS_NOSTATS is set to `true`, redirects won't be logged and there will be not stat available. Example:

```php
define('YOURLS_NOSTATS', true);
```

## Protecting your config file

A good practice, especially in a shared hosting environment, is to change file permissions to disallow write access to your files. The best thing to do is to edit your `config.php` with a new password, run YOURLS to get it encrypted, and then remove write permissions.

Depending on your host, you should change `config.php` permissions to 400, 440 or 600. This can be done via the command-line (`chmod 0440 config.php`) or using your FTP client. For more help on this matter, please contact your host support.
